    <p>1.  This graph shows a drag-free projectile using time step calculations.<br>
      2.  This graph shows an analytically modelled projectile using equally spaced x-coordinates.<br>This graph also has the apogee plotted.<br>
      3.  This graph shows highest/lowest angle to go through a given point. It also shows the lowest <br>speed trajectory that can be taken to go through that point.<br> 
      4.  This graph shows the original flight of a projectile compared with the flight when the launch <br>angle is optimised to give maximum horizontal range.<br>
      5.  Same as graph 3 but has a bounding curve which shows all the points the target coordinates<br>could be while still being in range of the projectile given inputs u,g and h.<br>
      6.  Same as graph 5 but with optimum angle and exact length of parabolic curve calculated.<br>
      7.1 Shows projectiles launched from same height and same intial velocity but with different <br>angles. Also shows their trajectories as if they don't hit the ground.<br>
      7.2 Shows range of projectiles against time with maximums and minimums for angles>=70.5.<br>
      8   Shows trajectory of a bouncy with coefficient of restitution C.<br>
      9.1 Shows drag incorporating model that recalculates gravity and air density at each <br>step to increase usefullness of model.<br>
      9.2 Compares drag-free model to drag incorporating model.
